Sam is an MRC Precision Medicine PhD student. His research focuses on the heterogeneity of depression, aiming to understand the causes and consequences of different forms of the condition, using longitudinal modelling and network analysis to identify clinically relevant patient subgroups, and genetic analyses such as genome-wide association, polygenic risk scores and mendelian randomisation to investigate the underlying genetic architecture and potential causal relationships.
